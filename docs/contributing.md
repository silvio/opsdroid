## Workflow

All contributors to the project, including maintainers, contribute using the following process:

 * Fork the main project to your own account
 * Work on your changes on a feature branch
 * Create a pull request back to the main project
 * Tests and test coverage will be checked automatically
 * A project maintainer will review and merge the pull request

## Developing

```shell
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid.git
cd opsdroid

# install the project in "editable" mode
pip install -e .

# run opsdroid
opsdroid start
```

### Running the tests

```shell
# install pre-commit hooks
pip install -U pre-commit

# set up pre-commit hooks (only needs to be done once)
pre-commit install

# install test runner
pip install -U tox

# run tests
tox
```

## Developing in containers

Developing in containers can be a great way to ensure that opsdroid will run in a clean python environment and that all dependencies are captured.

With the docker option '--build-args' a certain flavour of an image can be created for different purposes. Without this parameter a base image is created. The following flavours are currently supported:

* base: The base image for testing opsdroid
* dev: development
* readthedocs: environment for generating the documentation
* test: To run the test-suite


```shell
# build the container
docker build -t opsdroid/opsdroid:myfeature .

# run opsdroid
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app opsdroid/opsdroid:myfeature
```

### Running the tests

```shell
# run tests
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app opsdroid/opsdroid:myfeature tox
```

## Automatic Linting with Black

Opsdroid is running [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to deal with linting issues and it will be triggered when Travis runs our tests automatically. You can install Black on your machine and have it correct any linting issues that you might have.

### Install Black

Run the following command to install Black on your machine.

```shell
pip install black
```

_Note: You need to be running Python 3.6.0+ to have Black running._

You also need to have [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) installed and set up in order to have Black check your code and work on each git commit. If you followed the instructions on running the tests earlier on [Developing](#developing), you should have pre-commit set up already, and if not, please do it now.


### Using Black

Black will be triggered when you commit changes with the command `git commit`. You can then check your terminal for what sort of message you get from Black - either all is good or some files would be formatted.

#### Example of issues with linting

Let's imagine that you have added your files to stating and did `git commit -m 'my awesome feature`, then black will run on your terminal and show you something like this:

```bash
lint run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='4023478313'
lint run-test: commands[0] | flake8 --builtins=_ opsdroid
lint run-test: commands[1] | pydocstyle opsdroid tests
lint run-test: commands[2] | black --check opsdroid tests scripts setup.py versioneer.py
would reformat /home/travis/build/opsdroid/opsdroid/tests/test_connector_ciscospark.py
All done! üí• üíî üí•
1 file would be reformatted, 87 files would be left unchanged.
ERROR: InvocationError for command /home/travis/build/opsdroid/opsdroid/.tox/lint/bin/black --check opsdroid tests scripts setup.py versioneer.py (exited with code 1)
```

As you can see black tells you that it found some issues with linting on 1 file and since it reformats your code to fix the linting issues, it tells you that the file would be reformatted.

Black will change your file and if you go to `git status` you will see that your file was modified. You just need to add the files to starting again and commit them with the previous commit message. Afterwards, you can push the changes to your repository/PR.

#### Example of good linting

If your linting is good when you commit your changes you will see the following message:

```bash
lint run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='3517441289'
lint run-test: commands[0] | flake8 --builtins=_ opsdroid
lint run-test: commands[1] | pydocstyle opsdroid tests
lint run-test: commands[2] | black --check opsdroid tests scripts setup.py versioneer.py
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
88 files would be left unchanged.
___________________________________ summary ____________________________________
lint: commands succeeded
congratulations :)
```

This tells you that your linting is good and you can push these changes to Github.

## Documentation
More documentation is always appreciated and it's something that you can contribute to from the GitHub web interface.  This might be a great start point if you are new to Open Source and GitHub!

Things that we need help with:

 - More documentation. Something that you think is unclear?
 - More examples of how to use opsdroid
 - More Tutorials
 - Typos/Grammar check
 - Blog posts, articles, etc
 - Any issue marked with the [documentation tag](https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:documentation)

### Building the docs

Opsdroid's documentation is built using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) with the [Recommonmark](https://github.com/readthedocs/recommonmark) and [Napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) plugins and is hosted on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/).

You can build the documentation yourself locally and view them using the built in Python web server.

```console
$ tox -e docs  # or `sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/`
The HTML pages are in docs\_build.

$ cd docs/_build && python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://localhost:8000/) ...
```

### Writing documentation

All documentation should be written in [Basic English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English) where possible. We should try to keep words, phrases and grammar as simple as possible to make the project as accessible as possible.

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is our preferred markup language, although [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) (rst) is also supported. You may also embed portions of rst within your markdown documentation with the following syntax:

~~~
```eval_rst
.. warning::
   This is a warning admonition from rst within a markdown document.
   Useful because markdown doesn't have warnings.
```
~~~

Renders as:


```eval_rst
.. warning::
   This is a warning admonition from rst within a markdown document.
   Useful because markdown doesn't have warnings.
```

You can also use [Sphinx autodoc directives](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) to embed docstrings from the opsdroid module within your markdown documentation too.

~~~
```eval_rst
.. autofunction:: opsdroid.matchers.match_event
```
~~~

Renders as:

```eval_rst
.. autofunction:: opsdroid.matchers.match_event
   :noindex:
```

It is preferable to keep as much documentation within docstrings in the opsdroid codebase as possible and to include it in the documentation website using autodoc.

## Localization
Opsdroid runs by default in English, but it can be translated to your local language. In order to achieve it, [gettext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html) and [babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/index.html) are used.

To mark a string as translatable, just call the special `_` function:
```python
txt = 'hello {}'.format(name)  # this is NOT translatable
txt = _('hello {}').format(name)  # but now it's translatable! üéâ
```

When some new translatable strings are added, you must extract them to a non-versioned `pot` file with:
```shell
python setup.py extract_messages
```

Then, update all existing language `po` files from the extracted `pot` file with the command:
```shell
python setup.py update_catalog
```

Now, you can translate editing manually or with [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) the `po` files in `locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/opsdroid.po`. Those files contain the real translations and are versioned.

After you made a change in any `po` file, in order to view the changes in opsdroid, you should compile them to `mo` binary files, the format read by python gettext:
```shell
python setup.py compile_catalog
```

### Starting a new language
If your language is not in the `locale` folder, you can initialize it. You will need the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code of the language. For example, in order to start a new [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) translation:
```shell
python setup.py init_catalog -l eo
```
Then you can translate it in `locale/eo/LC_MESSAGES/opsdroid.po`, then compile it, etc.

## Creating New Modules
Opsdroid is an open source chatbot framework. It is designed to be extendable, scalable and simple. It comes with a few official modules that can be found in the [Opsdroid  GitHub account](https://github.com/opsdroid).

 If you love a particular platform and wish to use opsdroid with it or if you want opsdroid to interact with something in a certain way, you can create your own modules and extend the functionality of opsdroid.

 If you don't know where to start, make sure to check the [overview](overview) and read the [documentation](http://opsdroid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).  Remember that you can also ask for help in our [matrix channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#opsdroid-general:matrix.org)

## Creating Consistent Logging Messages

When creating log messages, we would like to see a consistency around how to structure and utilize them.

* In general any copyright/legal name should be Capitalized (i.e. Slack, Telegram)
* All usage of the opsdroid capabilities should be Capitalized (Connector, Skill, Database and Parsers)
* All sentances should end with a period.  
* When inserting specific text from an error message, end the sentance with a period.  



## Issues
You can help us by reporting new issues or by fixing existing issues.

If you find any part of opsdroid that's acting odd, it would be great if you take the time to create a new issue. That will help us keep opsdroid devoid of any bugs.

We try to tackle issues as fast as possible, but help would be greatly appreciated. To get started, simply follow the [workflow guidelines](#workflow) and developing instructions.
